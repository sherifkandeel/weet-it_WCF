//This is the question types file
//
//v0.1
//
//Please write "//" before comments.

//Format of this file is:
//Regex to match certain question is written in one line (in small letters)
//and the type of the question is written in the line after its regex.
//Regex starts with '^' to indicate the beginning of the string
//as the question keywords lies at the beginning of any sentence.
//example:
//		^how many	(regex)
//		count		(question type of the question that matches the above regex)
//
//Current Release Notes:

//1)In regex: add space to the words combinations that come after the main question keyword
//	example:
//			^could [ |you|tell|me|please]*
